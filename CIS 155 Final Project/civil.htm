			<h1> Captain America: Civil War </h1>
			<p>
			Heroes are the new villains. Or so it would seem from the latest installment
			in the Marvel Universe. Captain America: Civil War is slated to come out next
			spring, and the teaser trailer certainly teases. Can Captain American and Iron
			Man really stop being friends?
			</p>
			<p>
            Although the trailer is pretty vague, a quick snoop around the interwebs revealed
			some good news and some bad news. Iâ€™ll start with the bad: neither Thor nor the 
			Hulk will be in Civil War. On the bright side, it may be the first time Spiderman 
			appears with the Avengers.
			</p>
			<p>
              By now, every Marvel film has delivered, in both action, and simple but engaging 
			  plots. This one looks like it will live up to the standard that has been set, but also
			  be deliver a new viewing experience by blurring the line between hero and villain.
			<p>Here is a link to the official website for more information.
