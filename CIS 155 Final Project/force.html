			<h1> Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens </h1>
			<p>
				The original Star Wars fans have been waiting just shy of forty years
				for the final installment of the series to arrive. After the unanimous
				groan elicited by Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, the fandom collectively
				held their breath when they learned that Disney had purchased the
				Star Wars franchise and would be producing the final films of the trilogy.
				That collective breath was exhaled as a sigh of relief as soon as the trailer hit the internet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Seeing Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford reprise their roles as Princess Leia
				and Han Solo gives us major feels. The trailer leads us to understand that 
				it’s been many years since the events we saw in Return of the Jedi-- Solo and
				Leia are now approaching old age, and the Rebellion is mythic--but the 
				Millenium Falcon still looks as though it could win the Kessel Run..
			</p>
			<p>
				New faces are introduced along with the familiar, it’s refreshing to see some
				diverse protagonists. There’s just enough plot dangled to have many of us counting
				down the days to the release date, and not Christmas. Let us all hope that the movie
				can live up to the trailer.Here is a link to the official website for more information.
